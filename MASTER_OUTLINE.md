# CHICAGO NIGHTS - Master Outline

## ACT ONE: SETUP (Chapters 1-8)

### Chapter 1: "The Beating"

Cold open: Frankie Sullivan closing Sullivan's Tap on quiet Tuesday night, summer 1977. Hears commotion in back alley, finds three O'Malley enforcers beating her father with baseball bats—Donnie Murphy, Clarke, and Tommy Jr. They're breaking his legs first, making him scream. Father sees Frankie, tells her to run. She freezes. They finish him with bat to the skull, leave him bleeding in alley trash. Frankie cradles dying father, he can't speak. Dies in her arms. Enforcers gone. She calls ambulance but knows he's dead. Sits in blood until police arrive. Detective Kowalski takes statement, sees she's in shock. Chapter ends: Frankie in apartment above bar, numb, staring at father's empty chair. Body count: 1 (Sean Sullivan, murdered). Running total deaths: 1.

### Chapter 2: "The Funeral"

Three days later. Wake at Donnelly Funeral Home, closed casket (father too beaten to show). Entire neighborhood attends—regulars from bar, old friends, St. Gabriel's parishioners. Father Michael Byrne presides. Tommy O'Malley sends flowers (gross insult—everyone knows he ordered it). Kat Brennan stays close to Frankie. Whispered conversations about protection money, how Sean refused, how everyone knew this was coming. Frankie overhears: neighborhood terrified, no one will testify, cops won't touch O'Malleys. Funeral Mass at St. Gabriel's. Frankie watching O'Malley crew in back pew—Donnie Murphy smirking. Cemetery burial. Frankie emotionless throughout. Returns to bar, opens father's office, stares at gun safe. Chapter ends: Frankie's hand on safe dial. Body count: 0. Running total: 1.

### Chapter 3: "The Bat"

Frankie opens gun safe: Colt .38 revolver, Remington 870 shotgun, two boxes ammunition, father's signed Ernie Banks baseball bat (1969 Cubs). She takes .38 and bat. Loads revolver, slides it in waistband. Walks through South Side night carrying bat openly. People see her, say nothing. Arrives at O'Malley Social Club on 31st Street. Walks in. Donnie Murphy drinking at bar with two buddies. Sees Frankie, laughs—"Little Sully gonna cry?" She swings bat into his face, breaks nose, teeth. He goes down. She beats him—ribs, hands, knees—methodical, silent. His friends back away (not paid enough). Donnie begging, she doesn't stop. Finally: two bullets center mass from .38. Walks out. Chapter ends: Frankie walking home, bat bloody, .38 smoking. Body count: 1 (Donnie Murphy). Running total: 2.

### Chapter 4: "The Response"

Next morning. Tommy O'Malley learns Donnie's dead, beaten to death with baseball bat, shot twice. He's furious—disrespected by bartender's daughter. Calls meeting: brother Declan, cousin Kevin, lieutenant Eddie Riordan. Orders: bring Frankie in alive, make example. Declan sends three enforcers to grab her. Meanwhile: Frankie at Sullivan's Tap, cleaning bar mechanically, waiting. Detective Kowalski visits, warns her O'Malley will retaliate, urges her to leave town. She refuses. He sees revolver under bar, says nothing, leaves. Kat Brennan brings food, tries to convince Frankie to hide. Frankie: "They know where I live." Chapter ends: Frankie closing bar, going upstairs, loading shotgun, waiting in dark apartment. Body count: 0. Running total: 2.

### Chapter 5: "The Apartment"

Night. Three O'Malley enforcers (Clarke, Finn, Danny) break into apartment above bar. Frankie waiting in bedroom with shotgun. They split up searching (stupid). She kills Clarke in hallway—shotgun blast, close range, devastating. Finn fires wild with .45, misses. She pumps, fires again, hits him in chest. Danny runs for stairs, she shoots him in back. All three down, apartment destroyed. Frankie grabs .38, extra shells, father's Cubs jacket, leaves. Neighbors heard everything, no one calls cops for twenty minutes (giving her time). She goes to Kat's place. Chapter ends: Detective Kowalski at crime scene, rules it self-defense (breaking and entering), but warns Captain that gang war starting. Body count: 3 (Clarke, Finn, Danny). Running total: 5.

### Chapter 6: "The Price"

Tommy O'Malley escalates. Calls meeting with all enforcers and soldiers—twenty men in social club upstairs. Four dead in two days, all killed by one girl. He's humiliated. Puts $10,000 price on Frankie—dead or alive, he doesn't care anymore. Declan points out she's killing them on home territory, knows every alley, has neighborhood protecting her. Tommy doesn't care: find her, kill her. Meanwhile: Frankie at Kat's apartment, cleaning weapons, planning. Kat's boyfriend Jimmy (beat cop) warns that price on her head means every thug in Chicago hunting. Frankie knows. Father Byrne visits, offers church sanctuary. She declines—won't hide in church while hunting men. Chapter ends: Frankie leaves Kat's at dawn, heading to Sullivan's Tap to gather supplies. Two O'Malley soldiers watching bar from car across street. Body count: 0. Running total: 5.

### Chapter 7: "Broad Daylight"

Morning, South Side. Frankie approaches Sullivan's Tap, sees O'Malley car (two men watching). She walks straight toward them. They get out—Mackey and O'Brien, both armed. She's on busy street, witnesses everywhere. They hesitate (can't just shoot her in public). She doesn't. Pulls .38, fires four times—hits Mackey twice (down), O'Brien once (wounded, runs). Mackey bleeding out on sidewalk. Frankie retrieves spent shells, walks into her bar, locks door. Street chaos: witnesses screaming, someone calls police. Kowalski arrives, Frankie's already gone (out back alley). Later: news spreads through neighborhood—she shot them in broad daylight, didn't run, doesn't care. Chapter ends: Tommy O'Malley learning about Mackey, realizing she's not afraid, this is war. Point of no return established. Body count: 1 (Mackey). Running total: 6.

### Chapter 8: "No Turning Back"

Frankie in hiding at abandoned building near stockyards (childhood hideout, no one knows). Police looking for her, O'Malley crew hunting. She inventories: .38 (eight rounds left), hunting knife, father's jacket. Can't go back to bar. Can't leave Chicago. Only choice: forward through O'Malley organization until they're all dead or she is. Lists targets mentally: Declan O'Malley (killed her father), Eddie Riordan (collects protection), Tommy O'Malley (ordered it), all enforcers. Kat brings supplies: ammunition box (thirty .38 rounds from her cop boyfriend), food, cash. Warns Frankie that Tommy's bringing in guys from other crews, doubling security. Frankie doesn't care. Chapter ends: Frankie loading bullets, planning next hit. Act One complete—inciting incident done, heroine committed, stakes lethal, body count rising. Body count: 0. Running total: 6.

## ACT TWO: ESCALATION (Chapters 9-23)

### Chapter 9: "The Collector"

Frankie stalks Eddie Riordan, O'Malley's bagman who collects protection money. He has routine: Thursdays, visits ten businesses between 2-6 PM, always alone (nobody robs O'Malley collector). She waits outside Murphy's Pharmacy on 33rd. He exits with envelope of cash, walks to car. She approaches from behind in crowd, .38 against his spine, forces him into alley. He recognizes her, tries bribing. She shoots him in stomach (not fatal immediately), takes his cash ($2,400), leaves him. Calls ambulance from payphone after she's gone (not monster, but wants him to suffer first). He dies before EMTs arrive. Chapter ends: Tommy O'Malley receiving Eddie's cash in mail with note: "Protection money refund." Body count: 1 (Eddie Riordan). Running total: 7.

### Chapter 10: "The Bar Circuit"

O'Malley enforcers change tactics: travel in pairs, avoid alleys, carry bigger guns. Frankie adapts. Hits Mickey Doyle and Pat Sullivan (no relation) at Kerrigan's Tavern on 35th—they're drinking, celebrating Mackey's wake. She walks in wearing father's Cubs jacket (everyone recognizes her now). Bar goes silent. They reach for guns, she's faster—shoots Mickey twice, Pat once. Both down. Bar patrons scatter (no one saw anything). Bartender locks door after she leaves. Police arrive, everyone claims armed robbery, no descriptions. Kowalski knows better, can't prove it. Chapter ends: Neighborhood understanding she's untouchable—people protect her because they want O'Malleys gone. Body count: 2 (Mickey Doyle, Pat Sullivan). Running total: 9.

### Chapter 11: "Confession"

Frankie enters St. Gabriel's Church late night. Father Byrne in confessional. She kneels, begins: "Bless me Father, I've killed nine men." He recognizes voice, doesn't stop her. She confesses everything—beatings, shootings, planning more. Asks if she's damned. Byrne struggles: knows O'Malleys are evil, knows legal system failed, knows her father was good man. Tells her he can't absolve her while she's planning more violence, but God understands righteous anger. Gives her blessing anyway (breaking rules). She asks about soul. He says: "I don't know, Frankie. But I know your father would understand." No penance assigned. Chapter ends: Frankie lighting candle for father, praying for strength to finish, then leaving church to kill more men. Body count: 0. Running total: 9.

### Chapter 12: "The Girlfriend"

Frankie learns Declan O'Malley (her father's actual killer) has mistress—Siobhan, apartment in Bridgeport, Thursday afternoons. She stakes out building. Declan arrives 2 PM (big man, 6'3", ex-boxer), enters building. Frankie waits. Four hours later he exits alone, heads to car. She confronts him in parking lot with .38. He recognizes her, laughs—"You're dead, little girl." Reaches for .45. She shoots him in kneecap (payback for father's broken legs), he goes down roaring. She shoots other knee. He's crawling, begging. She takes father's baseball bat from jacket (been carrying it), beats him like he beat Sean Sullivan. Takes ten minutes. Doesn't kill him—leaves him crippled, screaming. Chapter ends: Declan in hospital (will never walk right), Tommy O'Malley learning his brother's destroyed. Body count: 0 (Declan lives). Running total: 9.

### Chapter 13: "Escalation"

Tommy O'Malley goes nuclear. Calls in favors from Italian Outfit, brings in outside muscle (five guys from Cicero). Doubles protection on himself, moves into social club upstairs apartment, won't come out. Puts $25,000 on Frankie (up from $10k). Orders: burn down Sullivan's Tap. Meanwhile: Frankie hiding in neighborhood basements, moving every night. Kat brings news about imported muscle. Father Byrne shelters her one night in church rectory. Detective Kowalski unofficially warns her through Kat that arson coming. Chapter ends: Frankie watching Sullivan's Tap from rooftop across street, knowing she can't defend it 24/7, accepting it's lost. Body count: 0. Running total: 9.

### Chapter 14: "The Burn"

Late night. Two O'Malley guys (imported Cicero muscle) break into Sullivan's Tap, pour gasoline, light it. Building goes up fast. Frankie watching from across street—sees Kat Brennan in upstairs apartment (she was staying there to protect it). Frankie runs in through smoke, finds Kat unconscious in bedroom, carries her out. Building engulfed. Fire trucks arrive too late. Sullivan's Tap destroyed—third-generation bar, father's life work, Frankie's inheritance, gone. Kat survives (smoke inhalation, hospitalized). Neighborhood watches it burn, silent. Frankie standing in street covered in soot, emotionless. Chapter ends: She walks to payphone, calls anonymous tip to police about arsonists' car (parked two blocks away), then disappears into alleys. Body count: 0. Running total: 9.

### Chapter 15: "The Midpoint"

Midpoint escalation. Frankie snaps after losing bar. Tracks the two Cicero arsonists to South Side hotel. They're drinking at hotel bar with three O'Malley soldiers (celebrating successful burn). Five men total. She walks in with .38 and fury. Starts shooting—drops first arsonist, second one, third guy reaches for gun (she shoots him). Bar chaos, she uses cover, reloads fast. Kills fourth guy (O'Malley soldier). Fifth runs, she chases through hotel, catches him in stairwell, shoots him. Police sirens. She exits through kitchen, disappears. Most public massacre yet—witnesses, hotel security cameras (grainy, 1977 quality), can't hide this. Chapter ends: Detective Kowalski at scene, five bodies, knows it's Frankie, can't officially admit it. Tommy O'Malley realizes she's beyond controlling. Body count: 5 (two arsonists, three soldiers). Running total: 14.

### Chapter 16: "The Hunt"

Police pressure increases. Kowalski's captain demands arrest. Kowalski slow-walks investigation (still sympathetic but can't ignore five bodies). Frankie now wanted officially—APB, stake-outs on known associates. She goes deep: abandoned buildings, moving nightly, no contact with Kat or Father Byrne (protecting them). Living rough: cold, hungry, exhausted. But still hunting. Identifies O'Malley soldiers by watching social club from distance. Notes patterns, routines. Kills one (Billy Corrigan) in alley behind club—waits by dumpster, he comes out to smoke, she shoots him twice, gone. Chapter ends: She's becoming ghost story—South Side whispers about the Sullivan girl who won't die, won't stop, kills O'Malley men like hunting season. Body count: 1 (Billy Corrigan). Running total: 15.

### Chapter 17: "The Informant"

Frankie needs intelligence on Tommy's location, security, routine. Captures low-level O'Malley associate (Petey Malone, 19, runner). Corners him in parking garage, beats information out with baseball bat (doesn't kill, just hurts). Learns: Tommy hiding in social club upstairs apartment, eight bodyguards rotating shifts, reinforced door, armed with shotguns. Only leaves for Sunday Mass at St. Gabriel's (ego won't let him miss). Petey begs for life. She lets him go (not soldier, just stupid kid). Petey runs, tells Tommy everything. Tommy moves Mass to different church (St. Sabina's), increases security. Chapter ends: Frankie realizing frontal assault on social club is suicide, needs different approach. Body count: 0. Running total: 15.

### Chapter 18: "Family Business"

Frankie goes after Tommy's family (psychological warfare). Not wife/kids (has limits), but cousin Kevin O'Malley who handles money. Kevin lives in Canaryville, walks to car every morning 7 AM (accountant, predictable). She waits in his garage. When he enters, she steps out with .38. He's not fighter, starts crying, offers money. She doesn't want money—wants him to deliver message to Tommy: "Your brother's crippled, your men are dead, your club is next, and you can't stop me." Shoots Kevin in shoulder (non-fatal, message delivery wound). Leaves him bleeding, calls ambulance from payphone. Chapter ends: Kevin in hospital, delivers message to Tommy, who realizes she's dismantling his organization piece by piece. Body count: 0 (Kevin lives). Running total: 15.

### Chapter 19: "The Trap"

Tommy sets trap. Spreads word through Petey Malone (knows Frankie let him live) that Tommy will be at cousin's warehouse on Friday night, minimal security, vulnerable. Frankie hears through neighborhood gossip. Knows it's probably trap. Goes anyway (calculated risk—might be real chance). Warehouse near stockyards, Friday 11 PM. She approaches cautiously. It's ambush: six O'Malley soldiers waiting, floodlights, crossfire setup. But Frankie anticipated—brought Molotov cocktails (gasoline in bottles, rags, matches). Lights them, throws into warehouse, creates chaos and fire. In confusion, picks off two soldiers with .38. Others flee fire. Building burns. Chapter ends: She escapes, two more dead, but realizes Tommy's getting smarter. Body count: 2 (O'Malley soldiers). Running total: 17.

### Chapter 20: "The Interrogation"

Frankie captures Francis Quinn, Tommy's driver/bodyguard. Lures him from social club with fake emergency call (friend injured). Grabs him in alley with shotgun. Takes him to abandoned meat packing plant. Ties him to chair, interrogates about social club layout, Tommy's exact location, security schedules, weak points. He resists. She uses baseball bat on hands, knees (not sadistic, but needs information). He breaks, tells everything: back entrance through basement, guard rotation times, Tommy sleeps 2-6 AM with only two guards outside door. She thanks him professionally, then shoots him twice (can't let him warn Tommy). Chapter ends: Frankie with intelligence needed for final assault, cleaning blood off bat, preparing. Body count: 1 (Francis Quinn). Running total: 18.

### Chapter 21: "The Brother"

Dark moment chapter. Frankie decides to draw Tommy out by hitting what he values most—his brother Declan (crippled but alive in hospital). She enters hospital late night, finds Declan's room (two guards outside). Creates distraction (fire alarm pulled), when guards investigate, she enters room. Declan awake, recognizes her, terrified (can't run, crippled). She doesn't shoot—too easy. Smothers him with pillow (personal, makes him feel helpless like father did). He struggles but can't fight. Dies slow. She leaves during alarm chaos. Chapter ends: Tommy O'Malley learning brother's dead, finally understanding Frankie won't stop, can't be reasoned with, must be killed. Body count: 1 (Declan O'Malley). Running total: 19.

### Chapter 22: "The Grief"

Frankie alone in abandoned church basement, processing what she's become. Has killed nineteen people in three weeks. Father dead, bar destroyed, home gone, wanted by police, living like animal. Brief moment of doubt: Is this what Sean Sullivan would want? Remembers father in alley, legs broken, screaming. Doubt vanishes. Cleans weapons methodically. Counts remaining ammunition: twelve .38 rounds, eight shotgun shells, baseball bat intact. Enough. Realizes she'll probably die in final assault. Accepts it. Writes short letter to Kat: "Thanks for everything. Reopen the bar if you can. —F" Chapter ends: She's ready for endgame. Body count: 0. Running total: 19.

### Chapter 23: "The Preparation"

Frankie prepares final assault. Acquires extra ammunition from Kat's boyfriend Jimmy (cop, sympathetic, gives her full box .38 rounds off books). Scouts social club over two days, confirms intelligence from Francis Quinn. Back entrance through basement, guard shift change 3 AM (sloppy, tired guards). Tommy inside with six remaining soldiers (organization decimated). Sunday night chosen: after Declan's funeral, they'll be drinking, emotional, less alert. Frankie tells Father Byrne her plan in confession, asks him to give her Last Rites (anticipating death). He does, blessing her weapons too (unorthodox but he's past caring). Chapter ends: Saturday midnight, Frankie in alley behind social club, watching, waiting for Sunday night. Act Two complete—organization crippled, body count high, heroine committed to death or victory. Body count: 0. Running total: 19.

## ACT THREE: RECKONING (Chapters 24-30)

### Chapter 24: "The Approach"

Sunday night, 3 AM. Frankie approaches O'Malley Social Club back entrance. Wears father's Cubs jacket, carries .38 in waistband, shotgun in hands, baseball bat slung on back, pockets full of shells. Basement door locked but rusty—she forces it with crowbar. Inside: dark, storage area, stairs up to main floor. Can hear voices above (men drinking, mourning Declan). She chambers shotgun shell, starts climbing stairs. Heart pounding but hands steady. At top: hallway, two guards outside door to main room (backs to her). She shoots first guard with shotgun, pumps, shoots second before he can turn. Both down. Main room erupts—shouting, scrambling. Chapter ends: She kicks door open into main room where Tommy O'Malley and six soldiers wait. Body count: 2 (guards). Running total: 21.

### Chapter 25: "The Club Fight"

Main room chaos. Six O'Malley soldiers scrambling for weapons. Frankie fires shotgun into group, hits one man, pumps, fires again. Drops shotgun (empty), pulls .38. Room is poker tables, chairs, bar—lots of cover. Soldiers shooting back, wild. She uses tables for cover, fires carefully. Drops second man (headshot, lucky). Third man charges with knife, she shoots him twice. Running gun battle through social club—she's moving, they're panicking. Fourth man behind bar, she flanges around, shoots him. Two soldiers left plus Tommy (hiding in back office). She reloads .38 with last shells, breathing hard, bleeding from graze on arm. Chapter ends: Four soldiers dead, two remaining with Tommy in office, her advancing with bat and gun. Body count: 4 (soldiers). Running total: 25.

### Chapter 26: "The Office"

Frankie at office door. Inside: Tommy O'Malley, two remaining bodyguards (both with .45s). She's out of shotgun shells, six rounds in .38, baseball bat. Kicks door—bodyguards fire, she ducks, returns fire, hits one (down). Other bodyguard rushes her, she doesn't shoot (saving rounds for Tommy), swings bat into his knee, he collapses, she finishes with bat to head. Tommy behind desk with revolver, hands shaking. Long moment: she's standing in doorway, bat bloody, .38 aimed at him. He tries talking: offers money, apology, anything. She's silent. He shoots, misses (panicking). She shoots him in stomach (not fatal immediately, wants him to know it). He falls, bleeding. She approaches, stands over him. Chapter ends: Tommy O'Malley dying on office floor, looking up at Frankie Sullivan with her father's weapons. Body count: 3 (bodyguard, second bodyguard, Tommy O'Malley). Running total: 28.

### Chapter 27: "The Reckoning"

Frankie stands over dying Tommy O'Malley. He's begging, offering information, crying. She doesn't speak. Thinks of father in alley, legs broken, skull crushed, dying in her arms. Shoots Tommy twice more (finishes him). Searches office: finds cash ($30,000 in safe), ledgers (protection racket records), photographs of Tommy with corrupt cops and politicians. Takes cash and ledgers, leaves photos. Hears sirens approaching (someone called police). Sets fire to office with spilled whiskey and matches. Fire spreads to main room (bodies, poker tables, alcohol). Building going up. She exits through basement, emerges in alley as fire trucks arrive. Covered in blood and soot, carrying money and ledgers. Disappears into South Side alleys. Chapter ends: O'Malley Social Club burning, seven bodies inside, Tommy O'Malley dead, organization destroyed. Body count: 0 (already counted). Running total: 28.

### Chapter 28: "The Aftermath"

Dawn. Detective Kowalski at burning social club scene. Seven bodies recovered: Tommy O'Malley, six soldiers. Evidence of gun battle. Witnesses report woman entering building, gunshots, fire, woman leaving. No positive ID (everyone claims didn't see face). Kowalski knows it's Frankie, knows he should arrest her. Finds ledgers mysteriously delivered to precinct: protection racket records, bribed cops named, political connections exposed. He makes choice: closes case as gang violence, internal O'Malley civil war, no suspects. Meanwhile: Frankie at Kat's apartment, collapsing from exhaustion. Kat treats her wounds (graze on arm, bruises, cuts). Frankie gives Kat $20,000 cash: "Rebuild the bar." Chapter ends: Frankie sleeping for first time in three weeks, nightmares of father. Body count: 0. Running total: 28.

### Chapter 29: "The Investigation"

Week later. Police investigation wrapping up. Kowalski interviews Frankie formally (has to, for record). She has alibi: was at Kat's apartment all night (Kat confirms). No physical evidence linking her (cleaned up). Neighbors swear she wasn't in the area. Kowalski accepts alibi, closes case. Corrupt cops named in ledgers are arrested (separate investigation). O'Malley organization shattered—remaining soldiers fled Chicago, protection racket collapsed. Meanwhile: Frankie visits father's grave at cemetery, brings flowers, sits long time. Tells him it's done. Cries for first time since funeral (grief finally surfacing). Father Byrne finds her there, sits with her, says nothing. Chapter ends: She leaves cemetery, walks through South Side neighborhood as people nod at her (respect, fear, gratitude). Body count: 0. Running total: 28.

### Chapter 30: "Sullivan's Tap"

Six months later, winter 1977. Sullivan's Tap rebuilt (insurance money plus Frankie's cash from Tommy's safe). Grand reopening. Neighborhood turns out: regulars, old friends, families. Kat working as bartender alongside Frankie. New sign outside (still says Sullivan's Tap), father's photo behind bar, signed Ernie Banks baseball bat in case on wall (cleaned up, mounted). Frankie pours first beer, slides it down bar. Toasts: "To Sean Sullivan, who taught me everything." Everyone drinks. Business as usual. Detective Kowalski stops by for beer, nods at Frankie (understanding between them). Father Byrne blesses the bar. Chapter ends: Frankie behind bar where she grew up, pulling beers, listening to jukebox (Irish ballads), watching neighborhood she defended. Alive. Free. Home. Final line: "My father's daughter, running my father's bar, in my father's neighborhood. Exactly where I'm supposed to be." THE END. Body count: 0. Final total: 28.
