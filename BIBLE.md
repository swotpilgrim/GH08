# CHICAGO NIGHTS - Series Bible

## Story Premise

Frankie Sullivan, 22-year-old bartender at her father's South Side Chicago pub, watches Irish mob enforcers beat her father to death in the alley for refusing protection money—they break his legs with baseball bats first, making sure the neighborhood hears his screams. She closes the bar, opens her father's gun safe, takes his Colt .38 and his autographed Cubs baseball bat, then walks to the O'Malley social club and beats enforcer Donnie Murphy to death with the bat before putting two rounds in his chest. For the next three weeks, Frankie Sullivan becomes the most dangerous thing on Chicago's South Side, systematically hunting Tommy O'Malley's Irish mob through the same streets she grew up on. She's not trained, not professional—just a bartender's daughter who knows every alley, every loyal family, every place to hide in a ten-block radius. By the time she walks into the O'Malley social club with her father's weapons and twenty-seven bodies behind her, the South Side Irish community has chosen sides, and Tommy O'Malley learns that sometimes the neighborhood takes care of its own problems. Chicago, summer 1977.

## Protagonist Profile

**Frankie Sullivan** (Francesca Marie Sullivan)
Age: 22
Physical: 5'6", 135 lbs, dark auburn hair usually in ponytail, green eyes, freckles across nose and shoulders. Strong arms and shoulders from years hauling kegs and breaking up fights. Hands scarred from bar work—knife cuts, broken glass, burn from steam line. Dresses working-class: jeans, work boots, flannel shirts, father's old Cubs jacket. Face can look sweet until you see the eyes—cold when she's angry.

**Background:** Born and raised above Sullivan's Tap, the South Side pub her grandfather opened in 1949. Mother died when Frankie was eight (cancer), so she grew up in the bar—did homework at corner table, learned to pull beers at fourteen, started tending bar at eighteen. Never went to college, never wanted to. The bar was her inheritance, her world, her family business. Father taught her the trade: how to handle drunks, how to spot trouble, how to eighty-six someone without starting a brawl. Also taught her to fight—bar fights are occupational hazard, and South Side pubs don't call cops over every scuffle. She's been in fistfights since sixteen, broke a trucker's nose at nineteen, knows how to use a pool cue or beer bottle as weapon.

**Skills Acquisition:** Fighting skills from bar life—not trained, but experienced. Knows how to take a punch, throw one, fight dirty when necessary. Father kept .38 revolver under bar, shotgun in back office—showed her how to shoot when she was fifteen (took her to indoor range in Bridgeport, Sunday mornings). She's competent with both weapons but not expert. Comfortable with baseball bat from years of softball (South Side women's league, played third base). Real advantage is geography—knows every street, alley, fire escape, basement entrance in her neighborhood. Knows which families hate the O'Malleys, which bars will hide her, which cops to avoid.

**Personality:** Quiet, observant, direct. Doesn't waste words. Listens more than she talks—bartender skill, you learn everyone's business. Loyal to her people, her neighborhood, her father's memory. Not impulsive (bar work teaches patience), but once decided, she's immovable. Comfortable with violence when necessary—grew up around it, doesn't romanticize it. Has worked-in dark humor typical of service industry. Doesn't drink much despite profession (saw too many regulars destroy themselves). No boyfriend currently—dated a mechanic last year, didn't work out. Few close friends, mostly women from neighborhood. Since father's death: cold, focused, operating on fury held under tight control.

**Combat Capability:** With .38 revolver—decent shot at close range (under twenty feet), struggles past that. Knows to aim center mass, not Hollywood headshots. Six rounds, keeps loose shells in jacket pocket, can reload but it takes time. With baseball bat—genuinely dangerous, years of softball swing mechanics plus bar-fight experience. Knows to go for knees, ribs, hands holding weapons. With shotgun (father's Remington 870)—devastating at close range, intimidating, but kicks hard and she's small. Fistfights—scrappy, knows to guard face, go for throat/groin/knees, use environment (break bottles, grab chairs). Not trained fighter, but fearless and practical. Main limitation: stamina—she's fit but not conditioned for extended combat.

**Current Situation:** Three days after father's murder. Funeral was yesterday (closed casket—mob beat him too badly). Bar is closed, black wreath on door. She's sleeping in apartment above bar, surrounded by father's things. Already killed Donnie Murphy. Knows O'Malley will send more. Doesn't care. Cleaned out father's gun safe: .38, shotgun, two boxes of ammunition. Father's baseball bat (signed by Ernie Banks, 1969—his most prized possession besides the bar). She's accepted she'll probably die doing this. Doesn't matter. Only thing that matters: taking every one of them with her.

## Villain Profile

**Tommy O'Malley** (Thomas Francis O'Malley)
Age: 47
Physical: 6'1", 220 lbs, going to fat but still powerful. Thick neck, heavy jaw, small eyes like a pig. Black hair slicked back with pomade, sideburns, missing half his left pinkie finger (lost in barroom brawl, 1965). Dresses mob sharp: tailored suits, silk ties, gold pinkie ring (right hand), gold crucifix on chain (never takes it off—gift from mother). Smokes cigars constantly, drinks Jameson neat. Face flushed red when angry (high blood pressure, refuses medication). Voice like gravel from cigarettes and shouting.

**Background:** Third-generation Irish mob, South Side born. Grandfather ran bootlegging during Prohibition, father ran numbers and protection rackets 1950s-60s. Tommy took over 1973 when father had stroke. Runs smaller operation than Italian Outfit but vicious enough to hold South Side Irish territory. Never did time—smart enough to have others do the work, connected enough to have cops and judges in pocket. Married to Maureen (trophy wife, twenty years younger), three kids in Catholic school. Lives in Bridgeport mansion, drives black Cadillac, acts like neighborhood king.

**Operation:** Protection rackets (bars, shops, construction sites), loan sharking, illegal gambling (backroom poker, sports betting), some hijacking and fencing. Controls roughly forty blocks of South Side Irish territory. Employs twenty-five enforcers/soldiers, another dozen associates. Main base: O'Malley Social Club (storefront on 31st Street—card games upstairs, legitimate social club downstairs, completely controlled space). Lieutenants: brother Declan O'Malley (muscle, runs enforcers), cousin Kevin O'Malley (bookkeeping, handles money), childhood friend Eddie Riordan (bag man, collects protection). Pays off two precinct captains, three beat cops, one alderman, one judge. Not huge organization, but entrenched.

**Evil M.O.:** Signature punishment—breaking legs with baseball bats before killing, making sure community hears victim scream. Sends message: cross O'Malley, you suffer publicly. Enforcers use aluminum bats (Louisville Sluggers), aim for knees and shins, take their time. Sometimes victim survives (crippled, warning). Sometimes they finish with bullet after. Bodies occasionally dumped in Chicago River, sometimes left in alleys as lessons. Frankie's father got the full treatment—ten minutes of screaming before they crushed his skull. Whole neighborhood heard. That was the point.

**Personality:** Thinks he's old-school Irish mob gentleman, actually just a thug with pretensions. Quotes his dead mother constantly ("Ma always said..."), wears crucifix but has no real faith. Explosive temper, especially when disrespected. Sees protection racket as "neighborhood tax" he's entitled to collect—genuinely doesn't understand why anyone would refuse. Loves being feared, being called "Mr. O'Malley," having people ask permission. Paternalistic toward Irish community (sponsors Little League, donates to church) but vicious to anyone who defies him. Drinks too much, gambles on horses, cheats on wife regularly. Underestimates Frankie because she's female, young, and "just a bartender"—fatal mistake.

**Weaknesses:** Ego demands he respond to challenges publicly. Routine—Tuesday nights at social club for poker, Sunday Mass at St. Gabriel's, Thursday afternoons at mistress's apartment. Trusts family over competence (brother Declan is loyal but stupid). Believes neighborhood truly respects him, doesn't realize they fear him and would turn given chance. Thinks cops he pays will protect him indefinitely. Most critical: doesn't take Frankie seriously until she's killed fifteen of his men, and by then it's too late.

**Relationship to Protagonist:** Ordered her father's death, didn't personally attend (sent Donnie Murphy and crew). Knew Sullivan's Tap for years—drank there in the '60s before he was boss, knew Frankie as a kid. Never thought twice about killing her father over $200/week protection money. When she kills Donnie, he's insulted more than threatened. When body count rises, he's furious but still thinks she'll be easy to eliminate. Doesn't understand he's fighting someone who knows his territory better than he does, who has nothing to lose, and who the neighborhood secretly wants dead. By the time he realizes the danger, she's already at his door.

## Supporting Characters

**Declan O'Malley** (Tommy's younger brother, 43)
Head enforcer for O'Malley mob. Built like brick shithouse—6'3", 240 lbs, ex-Golden Gloves boxer. Not bright but absolutely loyal to Tommy. Carries .45 automatic, prefers beating people with fists. Missing three teeth from boxing days, broken nose never set right. Married with five kids, lives in Canaryville. Genuinely believes in "Irish pride" and mob life as noble tradition. Led crew that killed Frankie's father—swung the bat himself. Frankie kills him in Chapter 27 during social club assault, beats him to death with her father's bat (poetic justice). Dies slow, recognizes the bat before he goes.

**Father Michael Byrne** (parish priest, 58)
Priest at St. Gabriel's Church, neighborhood fixture for thirty years. Knew Frankie since she was baptized, knew her father well (both Cork immigrants' sons). Gives her confession in Chapter 11 but doesn't try to stop her—knows O'Malley mob is cancer on community. Provides sanctuary briefly, warns her when O'Malley crew is hunting. Performs her father's funeral Mass. Old-school priest: believes in mercy but also justice, understands sometimes the law can't fix things. Survives story, blesses the reopened bar in final chapter. Represents neighborhood's quiet approval of Frankie's actions.

**Kathleen "Kat" Brennan** (childhood friend, 23)
Works as waitress at diner on 35th Street. Frankie's closest friend since grade school. Irish-Italian mix, tough South Side girl, lost her own brother to O'Malley loan sharks three years ago (suicide after they broke his hands). Provides Frankie with safe houses, information, alibi. Dates cop (beat cop named Jimmy, conflicted about helping), feeds Frankie intel on O'Malley crew movements. Nearly killed in Chapter 18 when O'Malleys burn Sullivan's Tap (Frankie rescues her from upstairs apartment). Survives, helps rebuild bar after. Represents loyal neighborhood friendship, civilian cost of mob war.

**Eddie Riordan** (O'Malley lieutenant, 45)
Bagman and collector for protection racket. Childhood friend of Tommy O'Malley, grew up together in Bridgeport. Thin, weaselly, smokes Pall Malls constantly. Carries snub-nose .38, rarely uses it. Smart enough to know Frankie is serious threat before Tommy does, tries to warn boss. Secretly hates Tommy (takes abuse, gets paid least) but too cowardly to leave. Frankie captures him in Chapter 20, beats information out of him about social club layout and Tommy's routine. She kills him after (two shots, execution style—he's begging, she doesn't care). Information he provides enables final assault.

**Sean Sullivan** (father, deceased)
Appears only in flashbacks and Frankie's memories. Age 54 at death. Bartender/owner Sullivan's Tap for twenty-eight years. Widower, raised Frankie alone after wife died. Cork accent never faded, hard worker, honest man, beloved in neighborhood. Refused O'Malley protection money on principle—wouldn't let them extort him, wouldn't collaborate with men who hurt his community. Knew it might get him killed, did it anyway. Taught Frankie everything: bar work, shooting, standing up for yourself, neighborhood loyalty. His ghost hangs over entire story—Frankie carries his weapons, wears his jacket, fights in his memory. The bar was his life's work; avenging him is hers.

**Detective Frank Kowalski** (Chicago PD, 51)
Homicide detective, not on O'Malley payroll (one of few clean cops on South Side). Polish-Irish mix, old-school policeman who actually cares. Investigates murders as Frankie's body count rises. Knows it's her, has evidence, could arrest her. Doesn't. Lost his own partner to mob hit in 1974, knows O'Malleys are untouchable through normal law. Quietly makes sure crime scenes get "contaminated," witnesses "don't remember details." Never directly helps Frankie, but doesn't stop her. Final scene: interviews her after social club fire, accepts her alibi (she was "home alone"), closes case as "gang violence." Represents system's failure and tacit approval when citizen takes justice into own hands.

## Setting Details

**Chicago, Summer 1977**
Post-Daley machine era, city finances crumbling, neighborhoods tribal and violent. South Side Irish territory roughly Bridgeport through Canaryville to McKinley Park—working-class, insular, fiercely Catholic, generational. Streets lined with brick bungalows, corner taverns every three blocks, churches anchoring each neighborhood. Economic decline visible: closed factories, shuttered storefronts, FOR SALE signs. City feels dangerous after dark—broken streetlights, alleys full of trash, police response slow if it comes at all.

**Sullivan's Tap (31st & Emerald)**
Classic neighborhood corner bar: brick building, neon Old Style sign, green awning faded from sun. Inside: long wooden bar (mahogany, polished smooth by decades), mirror behind bottles, black-and-white photos of Ireland on walls, Cubs pennants, signed baseball in case (Ernie Banks). Smell of beer, cigarettes, Murphy's Oil Soap on wood floors. Regulars' stools (everyone knows not to sit in Dirty Eddie's spot). Jukebox plays Irish rebel songs and Motown. Back room: office with cluttered desk, file cabinets, gun safe (old Mosler floor safe). Upstairs: three-room apartment where Frankie lives, accessible by back stairs from alley. Atmosphere of honest working-class refuge—the bar where neighborhood men cash paychecks, watch Sox games, mourn losses, celebrate births. Until O'Malleys burned it (Chapter 18), then Frankie rebuilds it.

**O'Malley Social Club (31st Street near Halsted)**
Storefront operation: social club legal front downstairs (old men playing cards, reading newspapers, drinking coffee), real business upstairs. Downstairs shabby—folding tables, metal chairs, linoleum floors, smell of cigars and instant coffee. Upstairs private: poker room (green felt tables, good lighting, armed guards at door), Tommy's office (big desk, leather chairs, wall safe, photos with politicians). Back exit to alley, reinforced door. Guards usually armed (.38s, .45s, sometimes shotgun). Fridays and Saturdays busy (poker games, sports betting), Tuesdays Tommy holds court. Atmosphere of casual menace—everybody's friendly until you cross someone, then you disappear. Frankie burns it to the ground in final chapter.

**South Side Streets & Alleys**
Urban landscape of narrow streets, brick buildings, tight alleys lined with dumpsters and fire escapes. Alleys critical to story—Frankie knows every shortcut, every basement entrance, every fence with loose board. Streets hostile after dark: broken glass, potholes, occasional burned-out car. Corner taverns every few blocks (O'Malley controls most through protection racket). Residential blocks: bungalows with chain-link fences, manicured tiny lawns (neighborhood pride despite poverty), Virgin Mary statues in gardens. Summer heat makes everything worse—garbage smells, tempers short, people sitting on stoops because apartments too hot. Elevated train rumbles overhead (Red Line), factory whistles mark shift changes. Atmosphere of tight community turning claustrophobic—everyone knows everyone, gossip travels fast, secrets impossible.

**Period Atmosphere**
1977 Chicago: Rotary phones, payphones on corners (Frankie uses for anonymous tips). Black-and-white TV, three networks. Cars American-made, huge, gas-guzzlers. Music from jukeboxes: Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Chicago, Irish ballads. Newspapers (Tribune, Sun-Times) matter, people read obituaries religiously. Cash economy—nobody uses credit cards in bars. Cigarettes everywhere (bars, churches, hospitals), ashtrays on every surface. Prices: beer 50¢, shot of Jameson $1, protection money $200/week, hit man $5,000. Fashion: polyester everywhere, wide collars, bell-bottoms fading, work clothes standard. Casual violence accepted—bar fights normal, domestic abuse ignored, mob hits page six news unless spectacular.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Prose Style:** Hard-boiled efficiency, working-class authentic, no literary flourishes. Short declarative sentences in action sequences, longer observational passages for atmosphere. First-person or tight third-person following Frankie—reader sees what she sees, knows what she knows. Sparse description of violence (graphic but not lingering—she shoots someone, they go down, move on). Period detail woven naturally through character knowledge (Frankie notices beer prices rising, jukebox song playing, make of car someone drives).

**Protagonist's Internal Voice:** Minimal introspection. Frankie doesn't philosophize or justify—she acts. Internal monologue practical: tactical assessment, memory of father, noting details. Grief expressed through action, not meditation. Dark humor occasionally (bartender's gallows humor). Example thought: "Donnie Murphy drank Schlitz and pinched waitresses. Now he's dead in the alley behind the club where he beat my father. Fuck him." Not: "As I stood over Donnie's body, I contemplated the moral weight of revenge and wondered what I was becoming."

**Dialogue Style:** Working-class Chicago Irish—profanity natural but not constant, period slang ("youse guys," "hinky," "breeze"), neighborhood speech patterns. Characters talk like real people: interruptions, fragments, implied context. O'Malley crew talks tough-guy mob (movie references, outdated slang). Older characters (priest, detective) more formal. Frankie direct and economical—doesn't waste words, speaks when necessary. Example: "You killed my father." Not: "You took away the only family I had left in this world."

**Violence Description:** Graphic but functional. When Frankie shoots someone: caliber, range, where it hits, immediate effect, move on. Baseball bat violence more visceral (bones breaking, blood, impact sound) because it's personal and brutal. No torture porn, no dwelling on suffering—violence is tool, consequence, justice. Deaths quick or mercifully off-screen for sympathetic characters. O'Malley crew deaths detailed enough for satisfaction but not gratuitous.

**Pacing:** Fast. Chapters open mid-action or immediate aftermath, close on hooks. Minimal downtime—when Frankie isn't hunting, she's planning, acquiring weapons, getting intelligence. Atmospheric passages brief (couple paragraphs maximum) before action resumes. Structure: action sequence, brief aftermath/planning, next action sequence. Three-act escalation: early kills quick/dirty, midpoint kills more tactical, final assault set piece.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary Weapon - Colt .38 Special Revolver (Father's):**
Six-shot revolver, blued steel, four-inch barrel, walnut grips worn smooth. Father bought it 1965 for under-bar protection. Frankie competent but not expert—decent at close range (under twenty feet), shaky beyond that. Carries loose shells in jacket pocket (no speedloaders—doesn't know they exist). Aims center mass like father taught her. Reliable, simple, doesn't jam. Limitation: six rounds, reload slow. She's conscious of round count, hates wasting shots.

**Secondary Weapon - Louisville Slugger Baseball Bat (Father's):**
Wooden bat, 34 inches, autographed by Ernie Banks (1969 Cubs). Father's prized possession, kept in office. Frankie has years of softball swing mechanics, knows bat work instinctively. Aims for knees, hands holding weapons, ribs, head when necessary. Poetic justice weapon—O'Malleys used bats on father, she uses bat on them. Brutal, personal, satisfying. Heavy enough to break bones, light enough for quick swings.

**Tertiary Weapon - Remington 870 Shotgun:**
Pump-action 12-gauge, five-round capacity, kept in bar office. Father used for intimidation more than shooting. Devastating at close range, room-clearer, but kicks hard and Frankie's small (weighs 135 lbs). Uses in apartment defense (Chapter 6) and final social club assault. Prefers .38 for mobility, but shotgun when she needs overwhelming force. Keeps extra shells in pockets, knows to pump after each shot.

**Tactical Approach:**
Frankie's not trained, but she's practical and knows her terrain. Ambush predator—waits for targets in familiar locations, strikes fast, disappears into neighborhood. Uses alleys, basements, friendly houses for escape routes. Hits targets when isolated (parking lots, walking to cars, outside mistress's apartments). Avoids fair fights—shoots from behind when possible, uses surprise. Plans exits before entering situations. Accepts risk of death but not stupid—doesn't throw life away. Learns as she goes (early kills messier, later kills more efficient).

**Combat Style:**
Close-range shooter. Bar-fighter brawler when necessary—knows to break bottles, grab chairs, go for eyes/throat/groin. Not graceful or trained, but fearless and practical. Willing to take damage to inflict damage. Uses environment: pushes someone down stairs, slams door on hand holding gun, throws beer bottles. Efficient, brutal, working-class scrappy. Reloads when safe, not under fire. Knows her limitations: avoids multiple attackers, doesn't try fancy shooting, sticks to simple tactics that work.

## Themes

**Primary Theme:** Justice vs. Law
When legal system is corrupted (cops on mob payroll, judges bought), ordinary citizens must choose: accept injustice or become outlaws themselves. Frankie chooses violence because law offers no recourse. Story doesn't moralize—simply shows working-class woman taking revenge when system fails her. Theme manifests through action: she kills, police investigate but don't stop her, neighborhood protects her, clean cops look away. Resolution: mob destroyed, law satisfied with "gang violence" verdict, unofficial justice served.

**Secondary Theme:** Neighborhood Loyalty
South Side Irish community as extended family—insular, protective, code of silence. O'Malley mob claims neighborhood loyalty but rules through fear. Frankie represents genuine loyalty: her father's daughter, born and raised there, defending home territory. As body count rises, neighborhood chooses sides—most quietly support her because they hated protection racket, feared O'Malleys, wanted them gone but couldn't act. Theme shows working-class solidarity when one of their own fights back against external oppression (even when oppressor is technically also Irish—but O'Malley separated himself by acting like royalty).

**Tertiary Theme:** Inheritance
What father passes to daughter: Sullivan's Tap (business, legacy), weapons (tools of survival), principles (stand up for yourself, don't let bullies win), neighborhood standing (reputation, connections). Frankie's revenge mission is honoring inheritance—father's life work was the bar, she reclaims it by destroying those who took it. Practical inheritance, not symbolic: she literally uses his gun and bat. Theme resolves with bar rebuilt, Frankie running it, continuing family business on her terms.

**Exploration Through Action:**
Themes emerge through plot, not preaching. Justice/law explored when cops investigate but don't arrest her. Loyalty shown when neighbors hide her, lie to police, celebrate O'Malley deaths. Inheritance demonstrated when she reopens bar, hangs father's photo, pours first beer. Frankie doesn't learn lessons or grow—she completes mission and returns to normal life. Resolution is practical: bad guys dead, bar reopened, neighborhood safer, life continues.
